# Arduino-Morse-Decoder

Upload the code then open serial monitor. You can now use the opush button to send your morse code. The code is set to 
8 words per minute but this can easily be modified. There will be a picture of the schematic incase you can't figure out how to wire it.

The LED is optional but it helpful to indicate wether the serial connection is functioning. You can also add in an active buzzer.
